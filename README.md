### Running the Bot

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. [Install Shuttle](https://docs.shuttle.rs/getting-started/installation)
3. Optional: [Install PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), you can also use a Docker container
4. Change the Database URL (`postgres://test:pass@localhost:5432/postgres`) in `main.rs` and `.env` to your local
   PostgresQL instance, leave it blank to use Docker.
5. Execute `setup.sql` in your DB
6. Create a Discord Bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
7. Copy the bot token and put it in a `Secrets.toml` file in the root directory:
    ```toml
    DISCORD_TOKEN = "your token here"
    ```
   You can also create a `Secrets.dev.toml` file if you want to test with different tokens in development.
8. Invite the bot to your server with the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission, you can also only choose the permissions you need.
9. Run the bot with `cargo run`

Some features also require a font and images from the `assets` folder.
Due to legal reasons, not all of them can be provided here. What's missing:

- `Rockwill.ttf`: [Rockwill](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/rockwill-font/)
- `obama_medal.jpg`: [Obama Medal](https://a.pinatafarm.com/1015x627/ade80aa63d/obama-medal.jpg)
- `mensa_plan.png`: [Mensa Plan](https://www.meck-architekten.de/projekte/id/2019-mensa-campus-garching/) or
  from [here](https://www.heinze.de/architekturobjekt/zoom/12979688/)

Simply download them and place them in the `assets` folder with the same name.

## Technical Overview

WoBot is a Discord Bot written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
with [the  Poise framework](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise/).
It's hosted on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) and uses a PostgresQL database.

The mensa plan uses the [Eat API](https://tum-dev.github.io/eat-api), the mensa coordinates link
to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).

The mensaplan API is written by myself and may become public in the future.

### Configuration

`config.hjson` uses a human-friendly JSON version, [HJson](https://hjson.github.io/).

You can set up automatic reactions and replies based on keywords. All of them are case-insensitive.
Auto-reactions also support regex and match on word boundaries, ignoring punctuation around them.
WoBot can react with both Unicode and custom Discord emojis, even animated ones.

#### Example Config

```hjson
{
  // channel for event threads
  event_channel_per_guild: {
    // guild_id: channel_id
    0: 0
  }
  role_removals: [
    {
      // If someone in guild has not written in channel in timeout_days days, the role gets removed
      guild_id: 1,
      channel_id: 2,
      role_id: 3,
      timeout_days: 30
    }
  ]
  auto_reactions: {
    robot: {
      name: "ðŸ¤–"
    }
    vibing: {
      animated: true
      name: vibing
      // emoji id
      id: 0
    }
  }
  auto_replies: [
    {
      keywords: [
        "wobot info"
        "wobot help"
      ]
